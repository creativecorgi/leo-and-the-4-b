      "Deep in the jungle, a young lion cub heard music and laughter drifting through the trees. Curious, he followed the sound and came across something he'd never seen before — a school! On the rooftop, painted in big bold letters, he saw: “Lowell Lions Love Learning.” “Lions? Learning?” he whispered, tilting his head. “I’m a lion... and I do love learning!”",
      "Leo crept closer and read a big sign near the entrance: Lowell Elementary. His eyes sparkled. “It looks fun... maybe I can learn something here,” he thought. Just then, the front doors opened and children walked out, giggling and chatting. One child noticed him and said, “Hi there!” Leo smiled shyly. “Hi... my name is Leo. I saw your roof sign and wanted to learn more.”",
      "The kids beamed. “Welcome, Leo! This is our school — do you want to come see what we do?” Leo nodded eagerly. “Yes, please! I want to learn everything.” “We’ll show you around and teach you something really important,” one student said. “It’s called the 4 B’s — it’s how we all take care of each other here.” Leo’s ears perked up. “That sounds important!”",
      "Inside the hallway, Leo saw four big, bold words on the wall: Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Ready. Each one was painted with bright colors and fun pictures. “These are the 4 B’s,” a teacher explained. “They help us all learn and grow together.” Leo read the words aloud. “Be Safe… Be Respectful… Be Responsible… Be Ready.”",
      "The students showed Leo how they walked in a quiet line through the hall. “We keep our hands and feet to ourselves and move carefully,” someone said. Leo watched them stop at each doorway and wait their turn to enter. “Being safe helps everyone feel calm and protected,” said the teacher. Leo practiced walking safely and smiled. “That feels nice!”",
      "In the classroom, Leo saw kids raising their hands before speaking. They listened quietly while others talked and used kind words. “Respect means we treat others the way we want to be treated,” said a student. “Even when we disagree, we stay calm and kind.” Leo nodded. “That makes everyone feel important.”",
      "In the lunch area, Leo noticed kids cleaning up after themselves. Some students even helped their friends carry trays or pick up spills. “Being responsible means doing the right thing, even when no one is watching,” a student explained. “We take care of our space, our things, and our learning.” Leo helped wipe a table and felt proud of his actions.",
      "Outside, students lined up quickly when the bell rang. “Being ready means having what you need and listening when it’s time to start,” the teacher said. Leo noticed how students had their backpacks, pencils, and big listening ears. “Being ready helps us learn more and feel less stressed,” one student shared. Leo checked his paws and said, “I’m ready too!”",
      "Back in the classroom, Leo said, “I think I understand the 4 B’s now.” “Be Safe, Be Respectful, Be Responsible, and Be Ready!” The kids clapped and cheered for him. The teacher gave Leo a special Lowell Lion Badge for learning the rules. “Thank you for teaching me!” Leo beamed.",
      "“Now you’re part of our Lowell family,” said the teacher warmly. Leo looked around at all the smiling faces. “I’ll try my best to follow the 4 B’s every day,” he promised. Everyone gave him a big group hug. From that day on, Leo was proud to be a Lowell Lion!"
